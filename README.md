## **Jokes Application**

Creating a jokes application using Flutter with API integration involves several key components and concepts.
JokeSplash is a cross-platform mobile app built with Flutter that delivers a daily dose of humor by fetching jokes from a remote API. Users can browse jokes by category, search for specific jokes, save their favorites, and share jokes with friends.
